        	 	<p>Creating an account on InkSmash is very simple and straight forward and can be set up in seconds.  All you need to do is enter the following information: Username, Email, Password, confirm password, and enter the text shown on the site to make sure you are human and not a bot.  Keep in mind when selecting the username your profile page will be located at inksmash.com/username.  We recommend choosing something you are comfortable sharing with others. See the image below:
               </p><p align="center"><img alt="" src="images/imgcreate-ac.jpg"></p>
               <p>After filling in all the information and clicking the "<strong>Join</strong>" button you will receive an email that will contain a link to confirm sign up. Once you click through to that link you are all set up.  You can now either spruce up your profile page by adding an image and a little bio about yourself or just start inking.</p>
