        	 	<p>Get paid on the posts you create.  Currently we have two ways on getting our members paid for the posts they create.  We know that our site wouldn't have any posts without its members so we thought it was important to provide most of the revenue share to you, the inker.  Here's how it works: first you will need to sign up for a Google Adsense account.  We will show you how.  Adsense will provide you with a unique code for your account.   Just plug that code into the earnings section when you log in and presto!! You're ready to get paid.  Each page you create will have dedicated areas for targeted Google ads based on your topic.  Google ads with your unique code will show up 70% of the time and our ads with our code will show up 30% of the time.</p>
                <p>Amazon ads work very similar except you're in charge of the products you display.  Using Amazon "blocks" can also be the most effective way to increase your earnings.  Here's how it works.  Sign up for an Amazon Associate account and once you receive your unique code just plug it into the earnings section of InkSmash.com.  While creating your post add the Amazon block to your posts and refer to any product on Amazon that relates to your post.  With over 100 million products currently selling on Amazon it shouldn't be difficult to link to a product that relates to your article or post.  Once someone clicks through the Amazon link and buys something you will get credit for that sale 70% of the time and InkSmash will get credit for it 30% of the time.  It's really that simple.</p>
