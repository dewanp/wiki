        	 	<p>Post type is the very first step in creating your post. There a number of different posts types to choose from depending on what your post is about.  We will go through each one in this section. </p>
                <p><span class="sub-title">News Post</span>News Post can be used for posting something that is going on in your local area.  Imagine being your own local news reporter for your town.  Discuss the local happenings around you, new places that are opening, events that are being hosted in your town or city, and more.  News posts can also be used for commentary on national and international stories.</p>
                <p><span class="sub-title">Recipe</span>Have you just created something new and amazing in the kitchen that you must share with the world?  Share it here.  Share the ingredients and instructions on how to make your awesome dish.  People can also comment on your dish, pastry, drink, or whatever else it might be that you have shared.  Now you can really find out what others think about your recipes.</p>
                <p><span class="sub-title">Ask a Question</span>Ask a question about anything you want and let the InkSmash community answer for you.  It could be anything from what Lady Gaga's real name is to how you convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.  Ask questions and answer them.  Help and be helped.</p>
<p><span class="sub-title">Blog Post</span>A blog post can be about anything.  It can be any general information that you have about a topic of your choosing.  You want to talk about why you think the Knicks lost last night, or what you think great parenting is all about then blog about it.  Tell the world what you think.</p>

<p><span class="sub-title">Reviews/Reports</span>Reviews and Reports can be about anything from products you own, restaurants you've been to or really anything you have an opinion about.  You can rate your experiences here and tell the world what you think. Be sure to make this type of content local if you are reviewing something in your town or city.</p>
<p><span class="sub-title">How to</span>In this section you can write a "how to" or a DIY (Do it yourself) about any topic that interests you.  It could be anything from how to tie your shoelaces, how to make the most unique wedding favors, to how to install kitchen cabinets.  The options are endless.  People are always searching the internet on how to do things on their own.  Find a topic that interests you and one that you know a great deal about and tell others how they can do it themselves.  We recommend that you post a video on the topic in this section.</p>

<p><span class="sub-title">Video Blog</span>InkSmash is not just for writers!  If you have a passion for something and writing is just not your thing, then post a video about it.  Instead of writing about a certain topic, create your own video of yourself speaking to your audience.  If you want to just stick to videos, go for it!  If you want to take it a step further you can also create a post with a video and write about it all within the same post.  The creative freedom is yours.</p>  

<p><span class="sub-title">Image Gallery</span>As they say, pictures paint a thousand words.  The Image Gallery section can used to illustrate an event, places you have visited, cars you love, your favorite wedding dresses, or anything that interests you.  Have the pictures tell your story.  You can add a short description to your complete set of images to tell your audience what your image gallery is all about.</p>
<p><span class="sub-title">Polls</span>Want to know how the InkSmash community feels about a certain subject?  Just poll them.  Create a poll on any topic you want.  Poll results are kept anonymous so poll them about all those taboo subjects we're not allowed to speak of like religion and politics.  Or just poll them about more important subjects like "Do you squeeze your toothpaste bottle from the bottom or the middle?" Don't forget to share your poll on all of the social networks you belong to. We want our readers answering polls here where you get paid to ask questions.</p>
