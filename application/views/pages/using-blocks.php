        	 	<p>The "Blocks" are essentially your building blocks within each of your posts. You can put as many of these blocks together and arrange them in any order you want to give your posts a more unique feel. Here is a list of the blocks you can add to each one of your posts:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Paragraph</li>
				<li>List</li>
				<li>Image</li>
				<li>Video</li>
				<li>Polls</li>
				<li>Reviews</li>
				<li>Amazon</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you are in the "Post Edit" page you will see an orange button on the left hand side that's called "Add more blocks".  Note: this button is also located at the end of the page.  See image below:</p>
                <p>Once you click on that button you can add as many blocks to your post as you'd like.  You can also arrange the blocks on the left hand side of the screen by dragging and dropping each block in the order you'd like; doing this will change the order that they display in your post.  You can always preview your post before publishing it to see if you are satisfied with the way it looks.</p>
