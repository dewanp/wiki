        	 	<p>Signing up for AdSense is easy.  This section will give you step by step instructions on how to sign up.  You first need to create one post before signing up for AdSense.  Without creating a post Google will not be able to see where your ads will be located and will not be able to verify your account for approval.  After you have written and published your first post go to the following page to apply for the AdSense account <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/adsense" hidefocus="true" style="outline: medium none;">http://www.google.com/adsense</a> note: if you already have an Adsense account DO NOT apply for another one.  Just plug in your code in the earning section of InkSmash.  It will look like the following: pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx and is located on the top right hand side of the page when you login to your AdSense account.  Include the "pub-" when providing us with the account number. </p>
                <p>If you are new to AdSense click on the "Sign Up Now" button on the top right.</p>
                <p><img alt="" src="images/img-adsense-ac.jpg"></p>
                <p>Once you've hit the sign up button you will be prompted to use a Google account you already have or sign up for a new one if you don't already have a Google account.</p>
                <p>The next step is very important.  In the field where it asks "I will show ads on" be sure to include your username in the url as shown in the image below.  For example: www.inksmash.com/username.  This step is very important and lets Google know where your ads will display.  If you forget to add your username in the url you provide you will not be approved for the AdSense account. </p>
                <p>For "Content Language" choose "English-English".  Read and accept the program policies and hit continue.</p>

                <p>In the next and final step you just have to add your personal information.  One important field here is to choose the "Individual Account".  DO NOT choose business account otherwise your application might not get approved.  Once you've entered all your information simply submit the application for Google to review.  Google might take up to one week to review the application but can reply in as little as a day.  Please see the image below:</p>

                <p>Once Google has approved your account, log in and find your "Publisher ID" (located on the top right hand side of the page) so you can plug it into InkSmash and start getting paid.  You can find this number on top as soon as you sign in.  It will have "pub- and 16 digits.  It will look like the following: pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.  When entering the Publisher ID in the earnings section on InkSmash make sure to enter the "pub-" as well as all the digits.  This does NOT allow us access to your account.  We will never ask you for your Google AdSense password and you should never provide it to anyone.  This code simply lets us display ads on InkSmash on your behalf.  That's it.  You're ready to get paid.</p>
