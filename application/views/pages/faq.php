          <p>It's really easy to create a post on InkSmash.  First choose a topic that interests you and one that you feel comfortable speaking about.  Next choose a suitable title for your post.  The title is more important than you may think and it may be among the most important ways people will find your content.  So make sure you choose a title that you believe people may search.  Next comes the type of content you would like to create.  We have provided many different post types ranging from blogs, videos, how to articles, local information, and more.  Once you've decided on the type of post, the category, and the title you should tag your content with keywords that best describes your post.  This is a very easy step that will enable your content to be found by search engines. We require that you enter at least 2 tags per post, and we recommend no more than 10.  Again, just like the title make sure you use keywords that you think people may search.  This will give you the opportunity to have more visibility.</p>
<p>Now comes the body of your post.  We have separated the body of the posts in 7 sections called "blocks".  The following blocks you can add to your posts are: Paragraph, List, Image, Video, Polls, Reviews, and you can link to Amazon products to monetize your content.  Depending on the type of post you choose there are suggested blocks for them, although you can choose to add as many different blocks as you would like.  You can also move the order of the blocks as you wish to customize your page.  Once you've selected your blocks fill them in with your content and if you are happy with the way it looks just go ahead and publish it, and begin promoting your content across the web.  Don't forget to share on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest.</p>

          <p>The "Blocks" are essentially your building blocks within each of your posts.  You can put as many as these blocks together and arrange them in any order you want to give your posts a more unique feel.  Here is a list of the blocks you can add to each one of your posts:</p>
          <ul>
<li>Paragraph</li>

          <p>While creating your post add the Amazon block to your posts and refer to any product on Amazon that relates to your post.  With over 100 million products currently selling on Amazon it shouldn't be difficult to link to a product that relates to your article or post.  Once someone clicks through the Amazon link and buys something you will get credit for that sale 70% of the time and InkSmash will get credit for it 30% of the time.  It's really that simple. </p>

          <p>Signing up for AdSense is easy.  This section will give you step by step instructions on how to sign up.  You first need to create one post before signing up for AdSense.  Without creating a post Google will not be able to see where your ads will be located and will not be able to verify your account for approval.  After you have written and published your first post go to the following page to apply for the AdSense account <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/adsense" hidefocus="true" style="outline: medium none;">http://www.google.com/adsense</a> note: if you already have an Adsense account DO NOT apply for another one.  Just plug in your code in the earning section of InkSmash.  It will look like the following: pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx and is located on the top right hand side of the page when you login to your AdSense account.  Include the "pub-" when providing us with the account number.</p>
<p>If you are new to AdSense click on the "Sign Up Now" button on the top right. </p>
