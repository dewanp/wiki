        	 	<p>The user dashboard is what you will see as soon as you login.  This dashboard is unique to you and your experience on InkSmash.  Here you will be able to do and see various things: like creating a post, viewing the amount of hits your posts have gotten, viewing the posts of the authors you are following, and much  more.</p>
                <p><strong>The following areas will help you navigate all of the features of InkSmash:</strong></p>
                <p><span class="sub-title">Create a post</span>  Just click the "create a post" button to get started creating a post.  Create a post in various post types and categories.</p>
                <p><span class="sub-title">View All Categories</span>  This section shows you a list of all the current categories on InkSmash.  Browse through your favorite categories to view content on the site, get inspiration, and find authors that interest you. </p>
                <h3 class="orangetitle-f16">My Area</h3>
                <p><span class="sub-title">My Feeds</span>  My Feeds shows you posts within "Network feeds" and "Local feeds".  Network feeds are posts from people that you are following and local feeds are posts from within the local area you are in.  Note: in order to see posts from others in this section you will have to start following other members and/or enter your zip code in the "Account Settings &amp; Privacy" section.</p>
<p><span class="sub-title">My Posts</span> Here you will be able to see all the posts that you have created, the status of each post, statistics on how many visitors viewed your content, and when the post was last edited.  You can also manage your posts in this section by editing, publishing, un-publishing or deleting posts.</p>

<p><span class="sub-title">My Favorites</span>  This section will have a list of posts that you have marked as "My Favorite" whether it's one of yours or from a fellow Inker you are following.  Other members will also be able to see your favorite posts in your profile page.</p>
<p><span class="sub-title">My Earnings</span>  This is the section that allows you to get paid for publishing and sharing your content.  When you sign up for a Google AdSense account or an Amazon Associates account this is where your ID code goes.  Once you have been approved, these accounts will provide you with a unique ID number.  Take that ID, plug it into the earnings section and that's it.  You're ready to start making some money!!</p>

<p><span class="sub-title">Following</span>  On InkSmash you can follow and be followed.  In the section under "People You Follow" and "People Following You" you can see the other InkSmash members following your posts, and see the members you are following.  Following members allows you to see their posts in your "My Feeds" section and allows others to see your posts once they follow you.  So go ahead, build an audience, be followed, and follow others.</p>  

<p><span class="sub-title">Messages</span>  In This section we've built a messaging and mail system so you can better interact with the members and community on InkSmash.  Here you can send them private messages, receive messages, and interact with others just like you would on email.</p>
<p><span class="sub-title">My Profile</span>Your profile page is your digital identity on InkSmash.  We recommend you upload a picture and tell other users a little bit about yourself.  We feel that putting a face and a description of you always helps in generating more followers.  Here you will find a list of all the great posts you have created and all the posts you have marked as your favorites.  This page is also your unique destination on InkSmash.  The address of your profile page will always be inksmash.com/username.  So choose something you like and don't change it too often because this will change the location of your posts and will make it hard for others to find you. This is also the page that advertisers (Google AdSense) will find you when applying to those accounts in order to make money on your content.</p>

<p><span class="sub-title">Account Settings &amp; Privacy</span>  Visit this section to make any changes to your account settings including: email, password, basic info, profile pic, and other account related items.</p>
