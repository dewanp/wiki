        	 	<p>The first step in making money on InkSmash is to provide readers and viewers with great, original, and unique content that is also entertaining to read and be a part of.  The better your posts are the more viewers and followers you will get.  This is the best way to build a big audience.</p>
                <p>Next, try to create posts about topics that interest you and topics that are relevant and highly searched at that given time.  If a topic is getting a lot of exposure in the media, or if the Olympics are taking place, now might be a good time to create a post on it.</p>
                <p>One of the best ways to make money on InkSmash is to sign up for an Amazon Associates account and use the Amazon Block.  The Amazon block allows you to create a section in each of your posts that link to any Amazon products of your choosing.  With over 100 million items to choose from you can probably find a product for just about any topic in your post.  For example: say you are posting a recipe for chili, at the end of your post you can add the Amazon block and link to all the ingredients you've used as well as the type of pots, or knives that Amazon is selling.  Each time one of those links are clicked and a purchase is made that will mean money in your pocket. (note: when you use the Amazon block to link to products, we will use your Amazon code 70% of the time to serve those ads and the other 30% of the time our code will be used to serve the ads). </p>
                <p>So create as many original posts as you can.  The more you create the more exposure you will get.  Just make sure your content is relevant, fresh, original, and entertaining.</p>
                <p>And don't forget to have fun!!</p>
