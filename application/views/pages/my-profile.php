        	 	<p>Your profile page is your digital identity on InkSmash.  We recommend you upload a picture and tell other users a little bit about yourself.  We feel that putting a face and a description of you always helps in generating more followers.  Here you will find a list of all the great posts you have created and all the posts you have marked as your favorites.  This page is also your unique destination on InkSmash.  The address of your profile page will always be inksmash.com/username.  So choose something you like and don't change it too often because this will change the location of your posts and will make it hard for others to find you. This is also the page that advertisers (Google AdSense) will find you when applying to those accounts in order to make money on your content.</p>
