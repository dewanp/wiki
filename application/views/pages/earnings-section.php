        	 	<p>At InkSmash there is nothing more important to us than our authors and content providers.  To show how much they mean to us we provide our authors the lion share of the ad space on each post you create.  What does that mean?  That means that 70% of the time your Google AdSense or Amazon Associates code will bring up the ads, and the other 30% of the time our code will bring up the ads.  This means that 70% of the revenue generated from ads will go to you and the other 30% will go to us.  In order to get paid from these advertisers you will need to sign up for a Google Adsense account and an Amazon Associate account then plug in the unique identifier in the InkSmash earnings section.  Signing up is easy and we will show you step by step instructions in this section.</p>
